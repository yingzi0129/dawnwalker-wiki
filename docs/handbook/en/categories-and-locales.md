## Where you are now and what this lesson solves

Sooner or later after launch you'll want to add a "weapons" category, or ship a Japanese version. This lesson turns each of those two tasks into a fixed recipe — follow it and you can't go wrong. **A lookup manual: jump to the section you need.**

## Request 1: Add a navigation category (e.g. "weapons")

You met the category rule in the architecture chapter: **three-place consistency, no place optional**. Adding `weapons`:

```bash
# 1. Content directory (create the directory first, then add the first article)
mkdir -p src/content/wiki/en/weapons

# 2. Config: add to src/config/navigation.ts following the existing entries' style
#    { key: 'weapons', icon: 'lucide:sword' }

# 3. Locale: add nav.weapons (navigation label) to src/locales/en.json
#    and overview.weapons (list page title and description)
```

Then run `pnpm check-config` (three-place consistency) + `pnpm build` (format check). The other languages' JSONs need the same key too (missing it won't break anything — the UI falls back to English — but `pnpm check-i18n` will list it to remind you).

Delegate to AI (copy the whole block, replace `weapons` with your category name):

```text
Add a new category "weapons" to the site. Change all three places consistently:
1. Add { key: 'weapons', icon: 'lucide:sword' } to src/config/navigation.ts, following the style of existing entries
2. Add nav.weapons and overview.weapons to src/locales/en.json, matching the copy style of existing categories
3. Create a skeleton article under src/content/wiki/en/weapons/ (schema-valid frontmatter, draft: true)
Also add the key to every other existing language's JSON. When finished, run pnpm check-config && pnpm build — only all-green counts as done.
```

## Request 2: Add a language (Japanese as the example)

Language three-place consistency: the language list config = the locale JSON files = the content directories.

```bash
# Step 1: run the scaffold (it asks for the language code, e.g. ja) — it generates the JSON skeleton and the content directory
pnpm new-locale
```

Step 2 — have AI translate the interface text (copy the whole block):

```text
I just added <language-code> with pnpm new-locale. Translate that language file:
translate src/locales/<language-code>.json key by key against src/locales/en.json,
do not add or remove keys; keep category keys consistent with navigation.ts.
Run pnpm check-config && pnpm check-i18n to verify — only all-green counts as done.
```

Step 3 — translate the articles (one at a time):

```text
Translate src/content/wiki/en/<category>/<slug>.mdx into <target-language> and
write it to the same path under src/content/wiki/<target-language>/. Rules: translate only
title/description/summary and the body; leave slug, dates, internal link paths, and the
code field of codes entries untouched; keep tags in English when no equivalent exists;
draft a glossary first so terminology stays consistent throughout. When done, run
pnpm check-content && pnpm build && pnpm check-i18n — only all-green counts as done.
```

Note: the codes themselves (the `code` field) are never translated — they are alphanumeric strings shared worldwide.

**The language switcher only lists languages that really have content** — while Japanese has zero articles, Japanese won't appear in the switcher. This prevents tap-into-a-blank-page moments.

## If you get stuck

- **"check-config reports a category mismatch"**: its output names exactly which of the three places doesn't line up — fill in what's missing.
- **"The build broke after translating articles into the new language"**: nine times out of ten a registration-card field got mangled during translation (a stray period in a date, that kind of thing); look at the exact file and line in the build error.

## ✅ Acceptance criteria (check the tasks you did)

- ☐ Added a category: `pnpm check-config && pnpm build` all green, the new category shows in navigation with a non-empty list
- ☐ Added a language: `pnpm check-i18n` reports nothing missing, the new language appears in the switcher

## Next steps

Customizations beyond categories and languages — changing the theme color, editing homepage copy, adding new article fields — are in the Learning Manual's [Theme & Homepage lesson](/landing/docs/theme-and-homepage).
