tldr: "Indexing is where traffic begins: only after Google shelves your pages in its library can you rank, and only rankings bring traffic. Do three things today: register Search Console (GSC — one environment variable proves ownership), submit the auto-generated sitemap, and click Request indexing for your 5 to 10 most important URLs. Bing and the AI engines take care of themselves — no work needed. On day 3 to 7, return to the weekly-ops lesson for your first data review."

## Where you are, and what this lesson solves

Last lesson your site went live and the whole world can reach it. But Google doesn't know you exist — nobody can find you in search. This lesson gets Google to start indexing your pages, the starting line between "a site exists" and "a site has traffic".

## What you'll have when this lesson is done

- Google Search Console (GSC) set up — all your traffic data lives here from now on
- The sitemap submitted, and key pages requested for indexing

## A few words to know

- **Indexing**: Google taking your pages into its "library". Indexed pages can rank; ranked pages get traffic. Google might take weeks to crawl a new site's pages on its own, which is why the third task below actively nudges it.
- **sitemap**: an auto-generated "site table of contents" handed to Google, telling it which pages you have and which were updated recently. You do nothing — the template generates it.
- **GSC (Google Search Console)**: the backstage where Google hands out report cards — who searched what, whether they clicked your site; it's all here from now on.

### Step 1: Register with Google Search Console (GSC)

**What to do**: get the "business registration" Google issues you.
**How to do it**: open [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console) → log into your Google account → **Add property**. Choose the **URL prefix** type, enter your `https://project-name.pages.dev` (or your domain), pick the **HTML tag** verification method, and Google hands you a snippet of code — you don't paste it yourself; take the string of letters inside the tag's `content="..."` and put it into an environment variable: name `PUBLIC_GSC_VERIFICATION`, value that string of letters. **Where the variable goes depends on your path**: if you deleted `wrangler.toml` in the take-it-live lesson, add it under Cloudflare → Settings → Variables and Secrets; if you kept `wrangler.toml`, put it in its `[vars]` section (while that file exists, dashboard settings are ignored — see the dev manual's feature-toggle chapter). Save and redeploy, then go back to GSC and click "Verify".
**You'll see**: GSC shows "Ownership verified".
**Confirm it worked**: the left sidebar of GSC opens pages like "Performance".

### Step 2: Submit the sitemap

**What to do**: hand Google the table-of-contents page the template generated.
**How to do it**: GSC left menu → **Sitemaps** → type `sitemap-index.xml` in the input box → click **Submit**.
**You'll see**: the status column shows "Success".
**Confirm it worked**: come back in a day or two and "Discovered URLs" has started climbing above 0.

### Step 3: Click Request indexing for key pages

**What to do**: Google might take weeks to crawl a new site's pages on its own — actively nudge the most important ones.
**How to do it**: in the inspection box at the top of GSC, paste your codes page's full URL and press Enter → click **Request indexing**. Run the most important 5 to 10 URLs through one by one (codes page first).
**You'll see**: each URL shows "Indexing requested".

Two more things happen automatically — no action from you: **once you buy your own domain and put it on Cloudflare**, Cloudflare notifies Bing and other search engines for you (a feature called Crawler Hints — an automatic nudge to Bing; plain pages.dev addresses don't get it, which is fine since Google is the main engine), and your `/llms.txt` page tells AI engines like ChatGPT what content you have.

### Step 4: Push your whole site with IndexNow

**What it is**: a free protocol that lets you tell Bing and other search engines "come crawl these URLs" — no waiting for their crawlers to wander in.
**How to do it**: this template ships a command for it, `pnpm submit-indexnow` (run it in the project root). It reads the sitemap you just built and pushes every URL on the site in one shot. The first run generates a key file, `public/<key>.txt` — commit that file, deploy once, then run the command again and the push is done.
**When to run it**: after each new batch of pages is deployed. It takes seconds.
**One note**: Google doesn't take part in IndexNow (it only listens to the GSC flow), so this mainly speeds up Bing and the other engines; on the Google side, Steps 2 and 3 above are what matter.

### Post-launch self-check (optional, 5 minutes)

```bash
pnpm build
BASE_URL=https://your-url pnpm check-sitemap
pnpm check-links
```

All three run clean — every URL returns 200 (opens fine) and no internal link is dead — and the site is healthy.

**On day 3 to 7 after launch, do your first data review** — is CTR at 2%, are visits averaging 1.5 pages, are you adding 10+ pages a week? The four pass lines, plus how to install the Clarity heatmap, live in the weekly-ops lesson — that's where weekly data-reading lives from now on.

## If you get stuck

- **"GSC verification fails"**: confirm the `PUBLIC_GSC_VERIFICATION` value is the string inside the tag's content quotes (no quotes), that you really redeployed after saving, and that the variable went to the right place (dashboard Variables if you deleted wrangler.toml, the file's `[vars]` otherwise — see Step 1).
- **"Sitemap submission says couldn't fetch"**: wait a few hours and retry (Google's crawling lags); also confirm `https://your-domain/sitemap-index.xml` opens.
- **"Discovered URLs still 0 after days"**: wait a few more days and click Request indexing a few more rounds; indexing has its own pace, and the weekly-ops lesson's weekly routine keeps nudging it.
- **GSC's "Page indexing" report, four statuses at a glance**: "Indexed" = done, leave it alone; "Discovered – currently not indexed" = Google knows about the URL but hasn't crawled it yet — wait, or nudge it again with IndexNow / Request indexing; "Crawled – currently not indexed" = Google looked and judged the content thin or duplicate — go rework the page instead of pushing it over and over; "Excluded" = dropped for reasons like noindex, duplicate, or redirect — open each row, read the reason, and confirm it's something you set on purpose.

## ✅ Acceptance criteria (all must hold)

- GSC verified, sitemap submitted
- ☐ At least 5 URLs have had indexing requested (codes page first)
- ☐ You know where in GSC to check "Discovered URLs"

## Next step

Google has started crawling you — but turning traffic into money still takes two steps: ads, and weekly freshness. The next lesson turns the ad slots on. [Go to Turn On Ads, Start Earning](/landing/docs/enable-ads)
